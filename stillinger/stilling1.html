        <h2>Your role as a designer</h2>
        <p>As a designer in the ID team you will work closely with other designers, developers and managers within different areas of expertise centred around authentication and identity management.</p>
        <p>You will work with all phases of the development process: from the initial stages with data-driven design and user research to prototyping and testing in several iterations. The context in which we work in the team is a balance between our core values of Trust, Security, and Convenience. We have a fixed budget for user testing/user interviews.</p>
        <p>In addition, you will contribute to operating and updating the structure of our Design System together with your fellow designer. We are currently mainly using Sketch, Invision, Abstract and ZeroHeight. You have considerable flexibility in choice of tools and hardware.</p>

          <li>I like to engage the whole team – product managers, software engineers and other designers – in my design processes.</li>
          <li>I care about usability and accessibility, in addition to the aesthetics of a digital product.</li>
          <li>I know that I will never be able to fully represent the users with my perspective , so I always iterate my projects while talking to the end users and by testing my concepts.</li>
          <li>I value structure and consistency in my designs.</li>
          <li>I am excited to be a part of a product team that has a strong technical background.</li>
          <li>I will always aim for conducting rapid prototyping, taking early concepts to be tested with end-users.</li>
          <li>I have relevant higher education and/or work experience as Interaction Designer.</li>
          <li>I have experience with designing transitions and animations.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Our culture and what we offer</h2>
        <p>We take pride in our work and want to learn from our mistakes. Our managers believe that if we are allowed to own the problem, our skills will make sure the solution will be better and make the product even more awesome. Some colleagues voluntarily participate in cageball, practise yoga and compete in casual gaming. We have regular social gatherings and sometimes we also go out on the town for a beer to celebrate yet another monthly salary.</p>
        <p>We aim to develop ourselves professionally through hackathons, conferences and we have extensive access to e-learning platforms as well.  40 working hours each year to be used to educate yourself within a topic of your choice.</p>
        <p>Our culture builds on being diverse and international. We are an engaging and growing workplace with around 15 colleagues in Trondheim, Norway and a remote team in Kraków, Poland. We are a part of Telenor Digital, a company within Telenor Group, with 70 employees in total. This role is located in Tyholt, in Trondheim, Norway. Our working language is English.</p>
